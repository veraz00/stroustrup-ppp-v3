# PPP-3rd Edition 

## Why This Repo? 
I've been using Programming Principles and Practice Using C++ (3rd Edition) to learn C++. To solidify the learning, I've created this repository to force myself to look into drill and exercises. This repo includes solutions and exercises for the book. I'll be updating it regularly, aiming to complete at least two chapters per week.

By sharing my progress, I hope to inspire others on their C++ learning journey.

Let me know if you have any other questions.
